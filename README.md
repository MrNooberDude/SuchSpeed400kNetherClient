# SuchSpeed400kNetherClient
*This is a horrrible decompile lol idk what i did here
A decompiled version of SuchSpeed's 400k Nether Client. It's code is strangely similar to that of quickDaffy and Eric Gold's client tutorials. Anyway, here it is!
The "client" folder comes from the dir: src/minecraft/client. The other flies were to large and I'm a bit new, Sorry!

I don't see any copyright, so please tell me if there is.
